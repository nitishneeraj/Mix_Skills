========================================================================== Spring Boot Tutorial ========================================================================

1. Spring Boot ->
	: Spring Boot Tutorial provides basic and advanced concepts of Spring Framework.
	: Spring Boot such, as features, project, maven project, starter project wizard, Spring Initializr, CLI, applications, annotations, dependency management, 
		properties, starters, Actuator, JPA, JDBC, etc.
	: It provides an easier and faster way to set up, configure, and run both simple and web-based applications.
	: It is a Spring module that provides the RAD (Rapid Application Development) feature to the Spring Framework.
	
	Spring Framework + Embedded HTTP Servers(Tomcat,Jetty) - XML <bean> configuration or @configuration = Spring Boot

	: We can use Spring STS IDE or Spring Initializr to develop Spring Boot Java applications.


2. Why should we use Spring Boot Framework?
	. The dependency injection approach is used in Spring Boot.
	. It reduces the cost and development time of the application.
	. It contains powerful database transaction management capabilities.


3. Advantages of Spring Boot
	. It increases productivity and reduces development time.
	. There is no requirement for XML configuration.
	. It offers a CLI tool for developing and testing the Spring Boot application.
	. It offers the number of plug-ins.
	. It creates stand-alone Spring applications that can be started using Java -jar.

4. Goals of Spring Boot
	. The main goal of Spring Boot is to reduce development, unit test, and integration test time.
	. By providing Spring Boot Framework reduces Development time, Developer Effort, and increases productivity.	
	
5. Spring Boot Features
	. Web Development
	. SpringApplication
	. Logging
	. Security
	. Type-safe Configuration
	

6. Spring
	. Spring Framework is a widely used Java EE framework for building applications.
	. The developer writes a lot of code (boilerplate code) to do the minimal task.
	.  develop loosely coupled applications.
	. The primary feature of the Spring Framework is dependency injection.

7. Spring Boot
	. Spring Boot Framework is widely used to develop REST APIs.
	. It reduces boilerplate code.
	. It helps to create a stand-alone application with less configuration.
	. The primary feature of Spring Boot is Autoconfiguration.
	. Spring Boot offers embedded server such as Jetty and Tomcat, etc.

8. Spring Initializr
	. Spring Initializr is a web-based tool provided by the Pivotal Web Service. With the help of Spring Initializr, we can easily generate the structure 
		of the Spring Boot Project. 
	. It supports IDE STS, IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate, NetBeans, Eclipse.

9. Download and Install STS IDE
	. Spring Tool Suite (STS) IDE
	. Link->  https://spring.io/tools3/sts/all

10. Creating a Spring Boot Project
	. Step 1: Open the Spring initializr https://start.spring.io.
